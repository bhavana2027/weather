📘 Overview

The Weather Prediction Web App is a simple and interactive web application that shows real-time weather information for any city. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the OpenWeatherMap API, to fetch and display live weather data like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
